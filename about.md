I'm a Software Developer working at solving hard monitoring problems at Spotify.

I'm building [ReProto](https://github.com/reproto), a new IDL meant to improve how we build and
distributes schemas for JSON-based services.
There's a compiler written in Rust, you'll love it!

I maintain [Heroic](https://github.com/spotify/heroic), Spotify's massively scalable time series database.
