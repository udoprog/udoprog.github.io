It's been a few months since I released MÃ¼sli to the world. An [experimental
binary serialization framework]. I've used it quite happily in a few projects.
But there was one area which it didn't exactly fit.

[experimental binary serialization framework]: https://github.com/udoprog/musli

Say you have a database, a [dictionary] with millions of text entries and cross
references. And you want to perform sporadic but fast word lookups on the
command line. How do you store the database? 

[dictionary]: https://www.edrdg.org/jmdict/j_jmdict.html
[a fancy web-ui]: https://github.com/udoprog/jpv

We might opt to reach for some neat [binary serialization]. But even the fastest
framework takes seconds to load the data set, which just isn't that great of a
user experience for a CLI tool. This is understandable, because the job of a
deserializer is broadly to take byte array and turn it into a data structure
that the Rust application can use. Typically this is done by painstakingly walk
through the data and convert it to boxes or lists or other things that Rust
programmers can reason about.

For millions of text entries - those boxes, lists, and other things containing
millions of entries that need to be allocated, decoded, arranged, cuddled ...
work that inevitably takes up resources we'd rather not spend.

This is where zero-copy serialization might come in handy. Instead of loading
and processing the entire contents of the file, we might be able to map the file
as-is into the application and treat it as Rust data structures directly. In
essence a `&[u8]` to `&T` translation layer. Take a slice, return a reference to
some type we can work with.

Now I can see the look on your face, isn't that wildly `unsafe`?

<br>

Well yes. Of course it. Super duper `unsafe`[^safe-transmutes]. But it doesn't
have to be *unsound*.

[^safe-transmutes]: Maybe less so once
    [project-safe-transmute](https://github.com/rust-lang/project-safe-transmute)
    makes progress.

<br>

In this article I'll discuss what it takes to soundly map data directly onto
structures which are defined in Rust. And while doing so introduce a library I
spent the last couple of weeks working on to make that easier. Namely
[`musli-zerocopy`].

[`musli-zerocopy`]: https://docs.rs/musli-zerocopy

There are two directions I want to discuss, *soundly* converting a data
structure into a a slice, and *soundly* converting a slice into the reference of
a data structure.

As a basis there are a few things we should know about `&T`.
* The reference has to point to data which is aligned with respect to `T`;
* All bytes in `T` except for padding (we'll talk about this later) have to be
  initialized to some value, and;
* The bit pattern that is stores at `&T` has to be valid for `T`.

So if we take it in order. To convert a rust type into an slice we will have to
cover the topics of [*The #[repr(Rust)]
representation*](#the-reprrust-representation) and [*alignment and
padding*](#a-tour-into-alignment-and-padding). After that when when we discuss
converting a slice back into a Rust type we also need to cover the notion of
[*legal bit patterns*](#legal-bit-patterns).

So... onwards!

## The #[repr(Rust)] representation

Rust provides very few guarantees what the layout of a data structure should be.
While this might seem like a nuisance at first, it's actually very helpful.

When Rust sees a data structure like this:

```rust
struct Yoke {
    a: u8,
    number: u32,
    b: u8,
    c: u8,
    d: u8,
}

assert_eq!(std::mem::size_of::<Yoke>(), 8);
```

The size of the structure is `8`.

If we switch to `#[repr(C)]`, which *has* a well-defined layout, the size of the
structure increases to `12`.

```rust
#[repr(C)]
struct Yoke {
    a: u8,
    number: u32,
    b: u8,
    c: u8,
    d: u8,
}

assert_eq!(std::mem::size_of::<Yoke>(), 12);
```

This is because `#[repr(C)]` is required to order the fields per their
definition order, and respect each fields alignment its alignment is the
multiple of a memory address that a specific structure wants to be located on,
and for u32 that is 4. To achieve this Rust moves the location of the `number`
field. This causes some extra unused space to be used in the struct called
*padding*.

> **Note** An alignment is required to be a power of two, and `Yoke` itself
> inherits the largest alignment of its fields which ensures that as long as
> `Yoke` is aligned in memory, so too will `number`.

`#[repr(Rust)]` on the other hand is free to re-arrange the fields. `Yoke` might
be rewritten to this:

```rust
struct Yoke {
    number: u32,
    a: u8,
    b: u8,
    c: u8,
    d: u8,
}
```

Which neatly means that the alignment of all the fields is respected, and we
save space.

In order to ensure that a data structure is *valid*, we can't have Rust move
things around without telling us. So we're obligated to use `#[repr(C)]`. To do
this correctly we need to delve deeper into the next topic. A tour into
alignment and padding.

## A tour into alignment and padding

When Rust sees a structure like this:

```rust
#[repr(C)]
struct Yoke {
    a: u8,
    number: u32,
}
```

It internally treats it as something like this:

```rust
#[repr(C)]
struct Yoke {
    a: u8,
    _pad1: [u8; 3],
    number: u32,
}
```

So if we copy `Yoke` byte-by-byte, we will catch the value of `_pad1` and
`_pad2` as well. This causes a problem, because these values are not
*initialized*.

First, padding bytes are considered uninitialized. 

This is illustrated perfectly by our good friend Miri with this snippet:

```rust
use std::slice;
use std::mem::size_of;

#[repr(C)]
struct Yoke {
    a: u8,
    number: u32,
}

fn main() {
    let link = Yoke {
        a: 0x01,
        number: 0x02030405,
    };

    let bytes = unsafe {
        let ptr = (&link as *const Yoke).cast::<u8>();
        slice::from_raw_parts(ptr, size_of::<Yoke>())
    };

    // Touch the first byte in the padding between a and b.
    let b1 = bytes[1];
}
```

```text
error: Undefined Behavior: using uninitialized data, but this
       operation requires initialized memory
  --> src/main.rs:21:14
   |
21 |     let b1 = bytes[1];
   |              ^^^^^^^^ using uninitialized data, but this
                           operation requires initialized memory
```

While Miri strictly speaking isn't authoritative on all matters, it is right
here. So does this mean that there's nothing we can do?

Well yes, we can initialize the padding ourselves. For example, directly where
`Yoke` is stored:

```rust
use std::slice;
use std::mem::size_of;

#[repr(C)]
struct Yoke {
    a: u8,
    number: u32,
}

fn main() {
    let mut link = Yoke {
        a: 0x01,
        number: 0x02030405,
    };
    
    unsafe {
        let ptr = (&mut link as *mut Yoke).cast::<u8>();
        // Zero out three bytes of padding at offset 1
        ptr.add(1).write_bytes(0, 3);
    }

    let bytes = unsafe {
        let ptr = (&link as *const Yoke).cast::<u8>();
        slice::from_raw_parts(ptr, size_of::<Yoke>())
    };

    dbg!(&bytes);
}
```

> If that seems like too much, `musli-zerocopy` has a shorthand for the above

> [init_padding](https://docs.rs/musli-zerocopy/latest/musli_zerocopy/trait.ZeroCopy.html#method.init_padding),
> so the above becomes.

Deserialization seems easy in comparison. As long as we know that the buffer
we're using is initialized.

```rust
use std::mem::size_of;

#[derive(Debug)]
#[repr(C)]
struct Yoke {
    a: u8,
    number: u32,
}

fn main() {
    let bytes: [u8; size_of::<Yoke>()] = [1, 0, 0, 0, 5, 4, 3, 2];
    let link: &Yoke = unsafe { &*(&bytes as *const u8).cast::<Yoke>() };
    dbg!(&link);
}
```

But this is subtly wrong. As mentioned in the beginning `&T` has to reference a
`T` that is stored at an aligned memory location:

```text
error: Undefined Behavior: accessing memory with alignment 2,
       but alignment 4 is required
  --> src/main.rs:12:25
   |
12 |     let link = unsafe { &*(&bytes as *const u8).cast::<Yoke>() };
   |                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   |                         accessing memory with alignment 2,
   |                         but alignment 4 is required
```

The nasty part here is that if we're unlucky, we might've ended up loading
`Yoke` from an aligned memory address on the stack and wouldn't notice this
issue with Miri.

So for deserialization we have at least the problem of alignment. Luckily we
have tools for that. Including this hack:

```rust
use std::mem::size_of;

#[derive(Debug)]
#[repr(C)]
struct Yoke {
    a: u8,
    next: u32,
}

// Align `T` with respect to `Yoke`.
#[repr(C)]
struct Align<T>([Yoke; 0], T);

fn main() {
    let bytes: &Align<[u8; size_of::<Yoke>()]> = &Align([], [1, 0, 0, 0, 5, 4, 3, 2]);
    let link = unsafe { &*(&bytes.1 as *const u8).cast::<Yoke>() };
    dbg!(&link);
}
```

This stems from the fact that the alignment of the vector matches the largest
alignment of its elements. So even if the vector inside of `Align` is
zero-sized, it still forces the whole structure to be aligned by `Yoke`. Since
it's zero-sized, we must conclude that the subsequent `T` is stored at the same
location, which luckily for us now is aligned by `Yoke`.

This is a neat hack. And I do use it in some plakces to store the output of
`include_bytes!` in an aligned buffer. But as a tool it is rather clunky. We
have to decide on the alignment up front at compile time.

If only there was a [data structure] that understand how to align its memory...

Ah well, that's for later. First we need to covert another problem with
deserialization. What exactly constitutes a *legal bit patterns* for a
structure?

[data structure]: https://docs.rs/musli-zerocopy/latest/musli_zerocopy/struct.OwnedBuf.html

## Legal bit patterns

Let's revisit `Yoke`, but change the second field to be a `char` instead of a
`u32`. Of course we'll also rename it, because otherwise it would be confusing.

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
#[repr(C)]
struct Yoke {
    a: u8,
    character: char,
}
```

If we try to cast a byte array into this structure, we need to make sure that
all bit patterns are inhabitable by it. But what bit patterns can a `char`
inhabit?

Reading the [rust reference] and [`char::from_u32`] we can intuit that a `char`
is 4 bytes wide, but cannot inhabit all possible bit patterns that those 4 bytes
can represent.

[rust reference]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/types/textual.html
[`char::from_u32`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.char.html#method.from_u32

Miri seconds this:

```rust
struct Align<T>([char; 0], T);

fn main() {
    let values: Align<[u8; 4]> = Align([], 0x110000u32.to_ne_bytes());
    let c = unsafe { *(values.1.as_ptr() as *const u8).cast::<char>() };
}
```

```
  |
5 |     let c = unsafe { *(values.1.as_ptr() as *const u8).cast::<char>() };
  |                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  |                      constructing invalid value: encountered 0x00110000,
  |                      but expected a valid unicode scalar value
  |                      (in `0..=0x10FFFF` but not in `0xD800..=0xDFFF`)
```

This is how we'd define the *legal bit pattern* for any type `T` with a
`#[repr(C)]`:
* Each field must be a *legal bit pattern* at their corresponding *offsets*.
* If the type is an enum, there is a first secret field called the discriminant
  which determines which variant is used. Then *each field of the variant* has
  to have a *legal bit pattern* at their corresponding *offsets*.
* Padding regions are ignored.

So let's try to write a validator for `Yoke` which respects all these
requirements:

```rust
use std::mem::{align_of, size_of};

#[derive(Debug)]
#[repr(C)]
struct Yoke {
    a: u8,
    character: char,
}

#[derive(Debug)]
enum Error {
    NotAligned,
    BufferUnderflow,
    BadChar,
}

fn validate(bytes: &[u8]) -> Result<&Yoke, Error> {
    // Check that the buffer is aligned.
    if (bytes.as_ptr() as usize) % align_of::<Yoke>() != 0 {
        return Err(Error::NotAligned);
    }

    // Check that the buffer has the right number of bytes.
    if bytes.len() < size_of::<Yoke>() {
        return Err(Error::BufferUnderflow);
    }

    // Since the first field is an u8, it can inhabit *any* bit pattern.

    // Access the character field, at offset 4.
    let character_ptr: *const u32 = unsafe { bytes.as_ptr().add(4).cast::<u32>() };
    // Access the raw representation of character, which is a u32.
    let character_raw = unsafe { character_ptr.read_unaligned() };
    // Test that the raw representation is a valid character.
    if char::from_u32(character_raw).is_none() {
        return Err(Error::BadChar);
    }

    // We've inspected all fields and they've passed, so now we're good to cast the reference.
    Ok(unsafe { &*bytes.as_ptr().cast() })
}

struct Align<T>([Yoke; 0], T);

fn main() {
    let data = Align([], [42, 0, 0, 0, 80, 0, 0, 0]);
    let link = validate(&data.1);
    dbg!(link);
}
```

That is... a lot. And we still have to align the buffer ourself.

## Making it easier

The goal of [`musli-zerocopy`] is making the above work easier while providing
high level tooling like references, slices or even other collections to build
and interact with complex data structures with ease.

This is what it looks like:

[`musli-zerocopy`]: https://docs.rs/musli-zerocopy

```rust
use musli_zerocopy::buf;
use musli_zerocopy::{Ref, ZeroCopy};

#[derive(ZeroCopy)]
#[repr(C)]
struct Person {
    age: u8,
    name: Ref<str>,
}

let buf = buf::aligned_buf::<Person>(include_bytes!("author.bin"));
let person = Person::from_bytes(&buf[..])?;

assert_eq!(person.age, 35);
// References are incrementally validated.
assert_eq!(buf.load(person.name)?, "John-John");
```

And this is the code that wrote `author.bin`:

```rust
use std::fs;
use musli_zerocopy::{OwnedBuf, Ref, ZeroCopy};

fn main() -> Result<()> {
    let mut buf = OwnedBuf::new();

    // Insert an uninitialized value to ensure that the person data is
    // stored at offset 0.
    let person = buf.store_uninit::<Person>();

    let value = Person {
        age: 35,
        name: buf.store_unsized("John-John"),
    };

    buf.load_uninit_mut(person).write(&value);
    fs::write("person.bin", &buf[..])?;
    Ok(())
}
```

This takes care of padding, alignment, and validation for most Rust types which
have a stable well-defined layout. We provide tools to easily build correct,
rich applications leveraging zero-copy data structures. It is [*really* fast],
and should be memory safe (assuming there are no bugs or false assumptions from
my part).

I also want to emphasize the focus on *incremental* rather than up front
validation, which ensures that startup is fast and doesn't needlessly consume
system resources. Incremental validation means that instead of validating the
whole structure in one go, we only validate the elements which are accessed,
like with `buf.load(person.name)?` above.

[hash maps]: https://docs.rs/musli-zerocopy/latest/musli_zerocopy/swiss/index.html
[*really* fast]: https://github.com/udoprog/musli/blob/main/benchmarks.md#m%C3%BCsli-vs-rkyv

## Tackling the dictionary

To loop back to what started me down this path, this is what the index of [my dictionary]
currently looks like using `musli-zerocopy`:

```rust
use musli_zerocopy::swiss::MapRef;
use musli_zerocopy::{Ref, ZeroCopy};

use crate::{PartOfSpeech, Id};

#[derive(ZeroCopy)]
#[repr(C)]
struct Index {
    lookup: MapRef<Ref<str>, Ref<[Id]>>,
    by_pos: MapRef<PartOfSpeech, Ref<[u32]>>,
    by_sequence: MapRef<u32, u32>,
}
```

> This project is also what needed map. So I've ported [`phf`] and `hashbrown`
> (named [`swiss`]) to the project. The above uses `swiss` maps.

The index stores tens of millions of entries. Loading the same index using other
MÃ¼sli formats and validated [`rkyv`] takes a second or two while pinning a CPU
core to 100%, which actually isn't fast enough for a CLI tool to feel
responsive.

The dictionary itself also uses a neat trick to perform string de-duplication,
by referencing subsets of already stored string by their prefix if they are
present. This in itself saves about 1G of space and I believe showcases what you
can accomplish when you have access to granular tooling:

```rust
let input: Vec<(String, Id)> = /* .. */;
let mut buf: OwnedBuf = /* .. */;

let mut lookup = HashMap::<String, Vec<Id>>::new();
let mut existing = HashMap::<_, usize>::new();
let mut reuse = 0usize;
let mut total = 0usize;

for (index, (key, id)) in input.into_iter().enumerate() {
    if index % 100000 == 0 {
        tracing::info!("Building strings: {}: {key}", index);
    }

    total += 1;

    let (unsize, substring) = if let Some(existing) = existing.get(key.as_ref()) {
        reuse += 1;
        (Ref::with_metadata(*existing, key.len()), true)
    } else {
        let unsize = buf.store_unsized(key.as_ref());
        (unsize, false)
    };

    lookup.entry(unsize).or_default().push(id);

    if !substring {
        // Generate string prefixes and insert into existing map.
        for (n, _) in key.char_indices() {
            let mut s = String::new();

            for c in key[n..].chars() {
                s.push(c);

                if !existing.contains_key(&s) {
                    existing.insert(s.clone(), unsize.offset() + n);
                }
            }
        }

        existing.insert(key.into_owned(), unsize.offset());
    }
}

tracing::info!("Reused {} string(s) (out of {})", reuse, total);
```

With this and thanks to incremental validation in `musli-zerocopy`, querying
through the CLI is both instantaneous and fully sound:

[![query performed in microseconds](../../assets/musli-zerocopy-cli-query.png)](../../assets/musli-zerocopy-cli-query.png)

[`rkyv`]: https://docs.rs/rkyv
[my dictionary]: https://github.com/udoprog/jpv/blob/main/crates/lib/src/database.rs#L303

## So what about this other crate?

Since people are bound to ask how this crate relates to those. `musli-zerocopy`
actually occupies a similar niche to `zerocopy`, but is fairly dissimilar from
`rkyv`.

This is what I write in the crate documentation:

* [`zerocopy`](https://docs.rs/zerocopy) doesn't support padded types[^padded],
  bytes to reference conversions, or conversions which does not permit decoding
  types unless all bit patterns can be inhabited by zeroes[^zeroes]. We still
  want to provide more of a complete toolkit that you'd need to build and
  interact with complex data structures like we get through the [`phf`] and
  [`swiss`] modules. This crate might indeed at some point make use of
  `zerocopy`'s traits.
* [`rkyv`](https://docs.rs/rkyv) operates on `#[repr(Rust)]` types and from this
  derives an optimized `Archived` variation for you. This library lets you build
  the equivalent of the  `Archived` variant directly and the way you interact
  with the data model doesn't incur the cost of validation up front. With `rkyv`
  it took my computer 100% of a CPU core and about half a second to load 12
  million dictionary entries[^dictionary], which is a cost that is simply not
  incurred by incrementally validating. Not validating is not an option since
  that would be wildly unsound - your application would be vulnerable to
  malicious dictionary files.

[^padded]: This is on zerocopy's roadmap, but it fundamentally doesn't play well
    with the central `FromBytes` / `ToBytes` pair of traits

[^zeroes]: [FromBytes extends
    FromZeroes](https://docs.rs/zerocopy/latest/zerocopy/trait.FromBytes.html)

[^dictionary]: [udoprog/jpv](https://github.com/udoprog/jpv/blob/main/crates/lib/src/database.rs)

`zerocopy` in particular deserves a massive shout out. [joshlf] has done
meticulous work [documenting] and [upstreaming] (!) layout guarantees which
benefits everyone in the ecosystem.

[`phf`]: https://docs.rs/musli-zerocopy/latest/musli_zerocopy/phf/index.html

So I think, and I hope you agree that there is some space to carve out for a
more holistic toolkit which operates directly over `#[repr(C)]` types. If you
do, I invite you to [take the project for a spin].
